How Decision Tree Work With Visualization
A node’s samples attribute counts how many training instances it applies to. For example, 100 training instances have a petal length greater than 2.45 cm (depth 1, right), among which 54 have a petal width smaller than 1.75 cm (depth 2, left). A node’s value attribute tells you how many training instances of each class this node applies to: for example, the bottom-right node applies to 0 Iris-Setosa, 1 IrisVersicolor, and 45 Iris-Virginica. Finally, a node’s gini attribute measures its impur‐ ity: a node is “pure” (gini=0) if all training instances it applies to belong to the same class. For example, since the depth-1 left node applies only to Iris-Setosa training instances, it is pure and its gini score is 0. ‐ rithm computes the gini score Gi of the ith node. For example, the depth-2 left node has a gini score equal to 1 – (0/54)2 – (49/54)2 – (5/54)2 ≈ 0.168. Another impurity measure is discussed shortly. . Gini impurity Gi = 1 − ∑ k = 1 n pi, k 2 • pi,k is the ratio of class k instances among the training instances in the i th node.
